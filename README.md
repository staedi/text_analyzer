# text_analyzer
This repository serves as the gateway for a simple text analyzer (Part-of-Speech and Named Entity Recognizer). While there are abundance of tools available to employ, `nltk` module was used for simplicity.

## Main Functions
To provide neccessary choices, two following options are provided by **radio button**.
* Dataset: If checked, a pre-loaded text sets of article headlines are used. Otherwise, users can input one of their own choice. Additionally, if this option is enabled, a single ticker should be selected as well for the analyses.
* Stopwords removal: By default, stop words including punctuations are removed before texts are analyzed. However, if needed, it can be turned off.
